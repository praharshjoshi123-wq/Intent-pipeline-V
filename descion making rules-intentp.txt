KEEP – intent is healthy

SPLIT – intent is overloaded, needs new branch

MERGE – two intents can be boiled down to one

MISSING_INTENT – something meaningful lives in FLAG

NO_ACTION_FLAG – ambiguous / insufficient data.


SPLIT when ALL are true:
Cluster count ≥ 2

At least 1 cluster has:

≥ 20–30% of messages in the bucket

Cohesion ≥ 0.75

Inter‑cluster similarity is low

Clusters imply different user actions or resolutions

DO NOT split if:
Differences are purely phrasing (same action)

Secondary intents would route to same business flow

Volume is too low (<30 messages total)




MISSING_INTENT when:
Messages are in FLAG

Cluster size ≥ threshold (say 40–50)

Cohesion ≥ 0.8

Pattern does not cleanly map to any existing intent

This is how you justify:

“The taxonomy is incomplete.”



MERGE when:
Two intents have:

High centroid similarity

Similar cluster structures

Same downstream action

Users would not care about the distinction



KEEP when:
Single dominant cluster

High cohesion

Low noise

No evidence of multiple tasks

NO_ACTION_FLAG when:
Cohesion low

Clusters unstable

Data too sparse or mixed


Add:

high – all rules strongly satisfied

medium – borderline but consistent

low – surfaced for review only



For a split---
High intra-cluster cohesion
→ proves semantic stability

Low inter-cluster similarity
→ proves it’s not just wording variation

Cluster is a substantial subset of the intent
→ proves it’s not edge noise

Different downstream action / resolution
→ proves the taxonomy is overloaded
